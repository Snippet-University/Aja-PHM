Aja-PHM
=======

Aja-PHM is a modeling platform for AmyClientele that is built upon a Python/TcL base and is accessed using the Cloudbursting Stock S-Terminal. The application 
executables are accessed using a dashboard and may consist of content or service based servelets which provided the user interface for such executables. 
An example would be to install a 3D virtual attendant, the correct dashboard make and model must be previously installed to call the 3D content and its interface. 
The dashboards are kitted with TcL and Python library files which redirect user input to the appropriate servelets being called.

==Introduction to Tweepcraft==

Tweepcraft is a mesh editing application in development for posable human models (PHM). It is compatible with COLLADA based meshes and Python based scripts. 

Our flagship model kit, 'AmyClientele' features different PHM designs and is ethnically balanced to encompass over seven different races.

Character kits such as "Amy, the Release" and a host of library scripts, textures and FBM/BM/HM content are in development mode and new builds are in production currently.

Tweepcraft also features the Antonia Polygon model and content that will be updated frequently. Testing of new features and compatibility will be the main goals. Periodic content drops of additional free material will be available for all registered members to use.

Tweepcraft is maintained at GitHub and exhibited at Deviant Art via API (Coming Soon).
